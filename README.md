<!-- My Journey -->
## My Journey 🚀
My journey as an inventor and entrepreneur has been marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible. From my early beginnings, I've always been driven by a curiosity to explore and create, leading me to craft innovative projects that have garnered recognition and acclaim.

**Early Years:**  
Kenny Neutron, born on May 28, 1997, entered the world with an innate curiosity that would shape his future endeavors. Growing up, he discovered a profound passion for invention, an inclination that would define his life's trajectory.

**High School Innovations:**  
Kenny's journey as an inventor began to gain momentum during his high school years. His exceptional aptitude for applied science earned him a coveted spot in the special science curriculum, setting the stage for a series of groundbreaking inventions. In 2011, the Goat Manure Battery marked his first notable invention, followed by the Rain Powered Generator in 2013. The latter not only garnered acclaim at the school level but also qualified for the prestigious 2013 Intel Science and Technology Fair, where it emerged as one of the Top 3 best research studies for applied science.

**College Pursuits:**  
Undeterred by success, Kenny pursued a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering in college. In 2016, during his second year, he presented the External Combustion Engine Generator, securing the most innovative award. His inventive spirit reached new heights in 2017 with the Electronic Mosquito Repellent Bracelet, earning him the title of Regional winner at the 2017 Regional Invention Contest.

**National Recognition and Professional Journey:**  
Kenny's talents transcended regional boundaries, leading him to the National Invention Contest in 2018, where he clinched the 3rd Placer position. Armed with a degree in Electronics Engineering earned in March 2019, Kenny ventured into the professional realm as an Application Engineer from 2019 to 2022.

**Continued Innovation:**  
In 2021, Kenny, now a professional, continued to make waves by securing the 3rd Placer in the regional invention contest for professionals with the AIDme Smart Watch—a testament to his unwavering commitment to innovation.

**Ventures Beyond:**  
Kenny's passion for technology with a purpose led to the co-founding of SIRENA AI in 2022, a startup dedicated to drowning detection. In 2023, he embarked on a new chapter by founding PROFtech, a company driven by inventive solutions and a commitment to shaping the future of technology.
