<!-- About Me -->
## About Me 🧠
- 🛠️ Inventor Extraordinaire
- 💼 Founder of PROFtech
- 🎓 Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering

<!-- My Journey -->
## My Journey 🚀
My journey as an inventor and entrepreneur has been marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible. From my early beginnings, I've always been driven by a curiosity to explore and create, leading me to craft innovative projects that have garnered recognition and acclaim.

**Early Beginnings:** My fascination with invention ignited during my high school years, where I embarked on a path of discovery that would shape my future endeavors. It was during this time that I conceived groundbreaking projects like the Goat Manure Battery and the Rain Powered Generator, which not only showcased my inventive spirit but also laid the foundation for my journey ahead.

**Professional Ventures:** After pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering, I transitioned into the professional world, where I continued to channel my passion for innovation. As an Application Engineer, I contributed to various projects, honing my skills and expertise while always striving to push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of technology.

**Entrepreneurship:** In 2022, I co-founded SIRENA AI, a startup dedicated to leveraging technology for a critical cause—drowning detection. This venture allowed me to combine my passion for innovation with a commitment to making a positive impact on society. Building on this foundation, I founded PROFtech in 2023, a company driven by a vision to pioneer professional technology solutions. With PROFtech, I aim to revolutionize the world of technology, one invention at a time, and to shape the future through innovative solutions that make a meaningful difference in people's lives.

My journey is a testament to the power of passion, perseverance, and a relentless drive to innovate. As I continue to chart new territories and explore uncharted horizons, I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible and shaping a future where technology serves as a catalyst for positive change.
